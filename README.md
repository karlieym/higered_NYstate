# Factors predicting college application numbers in New York State
**This is a project I did for my R course during my master's degree studies, where I noticed a decline in college applications in the United States.
  So I decided to find out the reasons that attract students' applications. Specifically, we will examine whether financial considerations, college 
  staff issues and different credentials that colleges might offer can significantly influence the number of applications in 2022.**
